For example, edges(network) returns an iterator of edge tuples with bus name values; (but if we used Graphs.edges(MetaGraph) we would get an iterator of Graphs.SimpleGraphs.SimpleEdge with integer values).\n\nA Network can be created directly, via a Dict, or a filepath. The minimum inputs must have a vector of Conductor specifications and a Network key containing at least the substation_bus.
