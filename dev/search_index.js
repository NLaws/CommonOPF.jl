Fieldnames can be provided via a YAML file, JSON file, or     populated manually. Conductors are specified via two busses, the impedance in ohms per-unit     length, and a length value. \n\nSingle phase models\n\nThe minimum inputs for a single phase conductor look like:\n\nconductors:\n  - busses: \n      - b1\n      - b2\n    r1: 0.1\n    x1: 0.1\n    length: 100\n\nNote that the order of the items in the YAML file does not matter.\n\nA conductor can also leverage a template, i.e. another conductor with a name that matches the template value so that we can re-use the impedance values:\n\nconductors:\n  - name: cond1\n    busses: \n      - b1\n      - b2\n    r1: 0.1\n    x1: 0.1\n    length: 100\n  - busses:\n      - b2\n      - b3\n    template: cond1\n    length: 200\n\nThe second conductor in the conductors above will use the r0 and x0 values from cond1, scaled by the length of 200 and normalized by Zbase.\n\nnote: Note\nThe name field is optional unless a conductor.name is also the template of another conductor.\n\nMulti-phase models\n\nMulti-phase conductors can be modeled as symmetrical or asymmetrical components. Similar to OpenDSS, line impedances can be specified via the zero and positive sequence impedances, (r0, x0) and (r1, x1) respectively; or via the lower-diagaonal portion of the phase-impedance matrix. \n\nUsing the Multi-phase models require specifing phases (and the zero and positive sequence impedances) like:\n\nconductors:\n  - busses: \n      - b1\n      - b2\n    phases:\n      - 2\n      - 3\n    r0: 0.766\n    x0: 1.944\n    r1: 0.301\n    x1: 0.627\n    length: 100\n\nWhen the sequence impedances are provided the phase-impedance matrix is determined using the math in Symmetrical Mutliphase Conductors.\n\nAlternatively one can specify the rmatrix and xmatrix like:\n\nconductors:\n  - busses: \n      - b1\n      - b2\n    phases:\n      - 1\n      - 3\n    rmatrix: \n      - [0.31]\n      - [0.15, 0.32]\n    xmatrix:\n      - [1.01]\n      - [0.5, 1.05]\n    length: 100\n\nwarning: Warning\nThe order of the phases is assumed to match the order of the rmatrix and xmatrix. For example using the example just above the 3x3 rmatrix looks like  031 0 015 0 0 0 015 0 032\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"inputs/#Loads","page":"Inputs","title":"Loads","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"inputs/","page":"Inputs","title":"Inputs","text":"CommonOPF.Load","category":"page"},{"location":"inputs/#CommonOPF.Load","page":"Inputs","title":"CommonOPF.Load","text":"struct Load <: AbstractBus\n\nA Load input specifier, mapped from YAML, JSON, or manually populated.\n\nThe minimum required inputs include several options. All require a bus to place the load. For single phase models provide one of the following sets of values:\n\nbus, kws1, kvars1\nbus, kws1, powerfactor\nbus, csv \n\nwhere csv is a path to a two column CSV file with a single line header like \"kws1,kvars1\".\n\nFor multiphase models any of the single phase options above can be used and the load will be split evenly across the phases (the Network.graph nodes will get attributes for kws2, kvars2, etc. as appropriate). Note that bus phases are inferred from the conductors.\n\nFor unbalanced multiphase models one must provide one of:\n\nbus, [kws1, kvars1], [kws2, kvars2], [kws3, kvars3] <â€“ brackets imply optional pairs, depending on the phases at the load bus\nbus, csv\n\nwhere the csv has 2, 4, or 6 columns with a single line header like \"kws1,kvars1,kws2,kvars2,kws3,kvars3\" or \"kws2,kvars2,kws3,kvars3\".\n\nnote: Note\nThe kws and kvars inputs are plural because we always put the loads in vectors, even with one timestep.
