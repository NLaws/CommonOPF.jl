Fieldnames can be provided via a YAML file, JSON file, or     populated manually. Conductors are specified via two busses, the impedance in ohms per-unit     length, and a length value. \n\nSingle phase models\n\nThe minimum inputs for a single phase conductor look like:\n\nConductor:\n  - busses: \n      - b1\n      - b2\n    r1: 0.1\n    x1: 0.1\n    length: 100\n\nNote that the order of the items in the YAML file does not matter.\n\nA conductor can also leverage a template, i.e. another conductor with a name that matches the template value so that we can re-use the impedance values:\n\nConductor:\n  - name: cond1\n    busses: \n      - b1\n      - b2\n    r1: 0.1\n    x1: 0.1\n    length: 100\n  - busses:\n      - b2\n      - b3\n    template: cond1\n    length: 200\n\nThe second conductor in the conductors above will use the r0 and x0 values from cond1, scaled by the length of 200 and normalized by Zbase.\n\nnote: Note\nThe name field is optional unless a conductor.name is also the template of another conductor.\n\nwarning: Warning\nIf any phases properties are set in the conductors then it is assumed that the model is  multi-phase.\n\nMulti-phase models\n\nMulti-phase conductors can be modeled as symmetrical or asymmetrical components. Similar to OpenDSS, line impedances can be specified via the zero and positive sequence impedances, (r0, x0) and (r1, x1) respectively; or via the lower-diagaonal portion of the phase-impedance matrix. \n\nUsing the Multi-phase models require specifing phases (and the zero and positive sequence impedances) like:\n\nConductor:\n  - busses: \n      - b1\n      - b2\n    phases:\n      - 2\n      - 3\n    r0: 0.766\n    x0: 1.944\n    r1: 0.301\n    x1: 0.627\n    length: 100\n\nWhen the sequence impedances are provided the phase-impedance matrix is determined using the math in Symmetrical Mutliphase Conductors.\n\nAlternatively one can specify the rmatrix and xmatrix like:\n\nConductor:\n  - busses: \n      - b1\n      - b2\n    phases:\n      - 1\n      - 3\n    rmatrix: \n      - [0.31]\n      - [0.15, 0.32]\n    xmatrix:\n      - [1.01]\n      - [0.5, 1.05]\n    length: 100\n\nwarning: Warning\nThe order of the phases is assumed to match the order of the rmatrix and xmatrix. For example using the example just above the 3x3 rmatrix looks like  031 0 015 0 0 0 015 0 032\n\nConductors also have a cmatrix attribute that is used when parsing OpenDSS models. The cmatrix is used to define ShuntAdmittance values for busses.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"inputs/#Load","page":"Inputs","title":"Load","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"inputs/","page":"Inputs","title":"Inputs","text":"CommonOPF.Load\nBase.getindex(net::Network, bus::String, kws_kvars::Symbol, phase::Int)","category":"page"},{"location":"inputs/#CommonOPF.Load","page":"Inputs","title":"CommonOPF.Load","text":"@with_kw mutable struct Load <: AbstractBus\n\nA Load input specifier, mapped from YAML, JSON, or manually populated.\n\nThe minimum required inputs include several options.
