## üìò CW ‚Äì Winding Data Code Summary

The `CW` field appears in **Line 1** of each transformer record and defines how PSS¬ÆE interprets **voltage bases** and **impedance bases** for the transformer windings.

| CW | Meaning | Voltage Base | Impedance Base |
|----|---------|---------------|----------------|
| 1  | Common base for all windings | Taken from bus base voltage (`BASKV`) | System base MVA (from header) |
| 2  | Each winding has its own MVA base | From bus base voltage (`BASKV`) | From `SBASE1-2`, `SBASE2-3`, etc. |
| 3  | Each winding uses its own **nominal voltage** and base | From `NOMV1`, `NOMV2`, `NOMV3` | From `SBASE1-2`, `SBASE2-3`, etc. |

> **Note:** When `CW = 1`, `NOMVx` values may be set to `0` and will default to the `BASKV` of the connected buses.
